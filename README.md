# Jenkins_pipeline_java-application_project

üîß Project Overview This project focuses on building and deploying a Java application using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. Below are the key steps involved:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Version Control (Git & GitHub):

    ‚Ä¢ The source code is managed using Git and hosted on GitHub.
    ‚Ä¢ Branches such as main and development are used to organize the codebase and track changes effectively.

2Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD with Jenkins:

    ‚Ä¢ Jenkins acts as the Continuous Integration server.
    ‚Ä¢ On each new code commit, Jenkins automatically pulls the latest changes from GitHub.
    ‚Ä¢ The application is built using Maven, and automated tests are executed.
    ‚Ä¢ If any tests fail, the build is marked as failed and the team is alerted.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Code Quality Analysis with SonarQube:

    ‚Ä¢ SonarQube is integrated into the Jenkins pipeline.
    ‚Ä¢ It analyzes the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
    ‚Ä¢ Reports are generated to ensure code quality before deployment.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Containerization with Docker:

    ‚Ä¢ The Java application is containerized using Docker.
    ‚Ä¢ A Dockerfile, stored in the Git repository, defines the runtime environment and required dependencies.
    ‚Ä¢ The resulting Docker image ensures a consistent deployment environment.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Image Hosting via Container Registry:

    ‚Ä¢ The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub (or another container registry).
    ‚Ä¢ Versioning and tagging help manage and identify application versions easily.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Deployment with Kubernetes & Webhooks:

    ‚Ä¢ Deployment to the Kubernetes cluster is automated using webhooks.
    ‚Ä¢ Whenever a new Docker image version is pushed, the webhook triggers an automatic deployment to the Kubernetes environment.
