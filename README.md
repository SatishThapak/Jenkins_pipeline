# Jenkins_pipeline_java-application_project

🔧 Project Overview This project focuses on building and deploying a Java application using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. Below are the key steps involved:

1️⃣ Version Control (Git & GitHub):
    • The source code is managed using Git and hosted on GitHub.
    • Branches such as main and development are used to organize the codebase and track changes effectively.

2️⃣ CI/CD with Jenkins:

    • Jenkins acts as the Continuous Integration server.
    • On each new code commit, Jenkins automatically pulls the latest changes from GitHub.
    • The application is built using Maven, and automated tests are executed.
    • If any tests fail, the build is marked as failed and the team is alerted.

3️⃣ Code Quality Analysis with SonarQube:

    • SonarQube is integrated into the Jenkins pipeline.
    • It analyzes the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
    • Reports are generated to ensure code quality before deployment.

4️⃣ Containerization with Docker:

    • The Java application is containerized using Docker.
    • A Dockerfile, stored in the Git repository, defines the runtime environment and required dependencies.
    • The resulting Docker image ensures a consistent deployment environment.

5️⃣ Image Hosting via Container Registry:

    • The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub (or another container registry).
    • Versioning and tagging help manage and identify application versions easily.

6️⃣ Continuous Deployment with Kubernetes & Webhooks:

    • Deployment to the Kubernetes cluster is automated using webhooks.
    • Whenever a new Docker image version is pushed, the webhook triggers an automatic deployment to the Kubernetes environment.
